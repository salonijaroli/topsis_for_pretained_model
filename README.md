# Topsis_for_pre-trained_model_of_sentence_similarity
Predicting Topsis score for already pre-trained models of sentence similarity
## Importing/loading Pre-trained models
In this project we have to import or load pre-trained models from hugging face using sentence_transformers
## Calculate topsis score
Calculate topsis score on basis of some features such as cosine similarity, manhattan distance,correlation,euclidean distance etc.
## Ranking
Rank the models on basis of topsis score that is obtained (higher the score, higher the rank ) and plotted the bar graph using seaborn
